# code-of-conduct

All members of the club are expected to abide by the following code of conduct.


## Constantly Strive to Optimize

We should look upto successful premiere Adhyatmik clubs established in **Institutes of National Importance across the country**.
Such examples include IIT Kanpur's and IIT Patna's Bhaktivedanta Club, IIT Bombay's Yogastha, IIT Madra and IIT Kanpur's Vivekananda Study Circle, and many more.

We should implement **best practices and systematic workflows** in everything we do to bring out the best results.

We should listen to feedback given by our seniors, peers and most importantly Professors of the institute to improve our working.


## Team Work

Initiatives from any member of the club is welcome. But all events and **activities must be co-ordinated in a systematic manner**. Make sure to put your request infront of you Domain Lead or CoLead.

Domain Leads and CoLeads must put forward the request to Lead. Lead must act in consensus with all domain leads, co-leads and special advisor.

**In case of any conflict of opinion regarding any matter, the instructions from Faculty Advisor must be followed.**

Nirvana should strive to collaborate with other technical and cultural clubs of the College, for events around the year.

## No Fights or Personal Comments

Do not make any personal comment on any other fellow Nirvana member or any other college student. **Nirvana members must abide by high standards of behaviour and avoid getting into any kind of unneccessary fights with anyone.**

**Differences of opinions are most appreaciated.** Students should engage in very civil and polite discussions to exchange their points of view.

Any hateful remarks against any person/group/community shall not be tolerated.

## No Discussion of Political Matters

Nirvana is strictly an Adhyatmik Club, focussed on achieving overall wellbeing and improvement of human life, through the exploration and implementation of Indic Philosophies, Yog, Medidation and other Self Development/Philosophical content.

All members must refrain from any political discussions within Nirvana. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


## Pluralism

**Pluralism stands for peaceful coexistence of different interests, convictions, and theories**. Multiple paths can be true simultaneusly.
Students should have an open-minded attitude to explore and learn.

We should live by the universal value of "**Ekam sat vipra bahuda Vadanti**" which  means that the truth is one, but the wise speak of it in many ways, implying that there are multiple paths, to achieve the ultimate higher goals of human life.



## Inclusivity

Inclusivity means that the club is open to everyone who is interested in study/research of the club's subject matter. **No discrimination shall be made on the basis of race,religion, gender, color, or any external factors.**

The only criterion for selection of members, or permission for an event is **MERIT and LOGICAL CORRECTNESS**.

Everyone in the club must be given equal oppurtunity irrespective of their background. **Promotion to Leadership positions should be made only on the basis of SKILLS**.

We should try to feel and live by the principle of "**Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam**" which signifies that the World is a Family. **We are indeed a family as all fellow earthlings are made of the same stardust and we all have evolved from the same microscopic ancient cell.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Mutual Respect

Mutual Respect stands for **respect in both directions**. We will respect you, if and only if, you also respect us. In all transactions within and outside Nirvana, the principle of Mutual Respect must be followed.

We should try to understand that all human beings have their own custom neural connections in their brain, as a result of consumption of different kinds of content. So getting into any verbal fights is not acceptable on differences of opinion.

We must try to understand the other person's point of view with due respect and patience, before presenting our ideas.





## Implementing in our own lives

Nirvana is not a place to lecture others about what's good/ideal. As members of Nirvana, we must practice the yogic/meditative/focus practices ourselves.

Members should strive to do the following on a regular basis:
1. Read/research about Indic Philosophies, schools of thought, books and yogic practices.
2. Practice Yog and Meditation in daily lives.
3. Live in peaceful, calm and stoic manner, and handle obstacles in life without ranting/complaining/crying.
